1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

R/ when I don't have my computer to do the process with Git

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

R/ Because someone could be editing the repository and if you pull it automatically, you can pull undesired code.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

R/ Fork is to take other people repository as your repository, clones is to get all the repository into your computer and branches is to parallel in the same work.
