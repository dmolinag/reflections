1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

R/ when I don't have my computer to do the process with Git

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

R/ Because someone could be editing the repository and if you pull it automatically, you can pull undesired code.
