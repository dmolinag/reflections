1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

R/ I can see just the differences between the files instead of read all the code.

2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

R/ I don't have to search in all the version looking for the mistake or bug.

3) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

R/ I can control the commits and also the history, I save the things that I think that are important.

4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

R/ The history of all commits and files are like more compact

5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

R/ git log is to see all the commits and git diff is to see the differences between 2 commits

6) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

R/ Because now I can go back to the commit where I made the mistake and reorginise it and continue working

7) Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

R/ Do good and interesting things
